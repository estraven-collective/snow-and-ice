# TO DO

- [ ] Document workflow.
- [ ] wider coordinate range, to include the full alps mountain range.
- [ ] Downsize records before saving data, to make the workflow lighter.
- [ ] Switch to from VIIRS to MODIS data to go further back in time?
  - VIIRS: 2012 - ongoing https://nsidc.org/data/vnp10/versions/2
  - MODIS: 2000 - ongoing (will be dismissed soon) https://nsidc.org/data/mod10_l2/versions/61
  - SMMR: 1966-2023 (binary coverage, very low resolution 25x25km) https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0046/versions/4
